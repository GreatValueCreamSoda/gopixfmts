Warning: This library is only intended for GO! bindings for getting pixel format properties and copying frame information using libavutil `pixfmt.h` and `pixdesc.h` headers and is not intended to be a full wrapper around libavutil or libav.

# Usage
See pkg.go.dev docs as well as ffmpegs doxygen docs.

# testing

Tests are currently a work in progress. Ill get to them when I do.

# Support
Any and all PRs that improve the quality of the code base or improve documentation are appreciated. The currently implemented headers are the limit of the scope of this package. Only new features added to them will be added to this package.
